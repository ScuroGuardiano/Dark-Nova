# Dark Nova
# Another attempt...

This is rewrite and another attempt of finishing Dark Nova

This time I'll use
1. ***Yarn*** for workspaces
2. ***NestJS*** + ***TypeORM*** for *SOLID* backend
3. ***Next.js*** for blazingly fast yet ***reactive*** frontend
4. ***Angular*** with ***ngx-ui*** for dope admin panel
5. ***Docker*** & ***Docker compose*** to wrap this s\*\*t like wrap from KFC*
###### * Project is not sponsored by KFC

# Running project
## Yarn
```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start # it will start everything in dev mode
```
Then go to:
* [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to access frontend
* [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin) to access admin panel
* [http://localhost:1337/api](http://localhost:1337/api) to access api

## npm
Use yarn.
